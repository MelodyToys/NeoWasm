## Update - 6/22/2021
I am having a hell of a time getting wasm3 to work on the esp8266 esp32 ... Under the [TESTING](https://github.com/sfranzyshen/wasm3_testing) folder are the files that I used to step through each stage of development ... I can individually verify each code section one by one with success ... but put it all together or multiple parts together and it fails ... usually with no message ... or some obscure error message ... it's obviously memory related

**my hopes for wasm3 have been dashed ...**

# NeoWasm 
**NeoWasm** is a Wasm3 Programmable NeoPixel LED Controller for the Arduino ESP environment with an easy to use Web UI

## Goal
Create a NeoPixel Controller that is programmed using a self hosted web based wasm compiler(s) to create 
binaries that are stored and loaded from the internal ROM filesystem.

## Status
**NeoWasm** is still very much in the ‘just hacked together’ … ‘prototype’ … ‘proof of concept’ stage …  

## Note
**NeoWasm** is a Arduino Sketch and not a Library ...

## Getting Started
See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/MelodyToys/NeoWasm/blob/main/GetStarted.md)
